# Minecraft-stats-combiner
Simple program to combine every one of your stats files into a merged one.
I decided to create it because I realized I couldn't find one.

Still in WIP. Can maybe be a bit buggy but the main fonctionality is working fine (locally at least)

#################################### How it's working ####################################

1. Install Python if it is not already done (on W11, if you run the script, it will sugest you to install it from windows store)
2. You have 2 choices here:
2.1 You can c&p your minecraft/curseforge path folder and the script will automatically import data from all your stats files. (fast and easy)
2.2 Regroup your stats files into stats_folder, theses files are located in the stats folder of any maps. (This is a far tedius process by far)
3. Launch main.py and follow the instructions.
4. Enjoy
