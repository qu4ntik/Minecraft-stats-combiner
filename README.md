# Minecraft-stats-combiner
Simple program to combine every one of your stats files into a merged one.
I decided to create it because I realized I couldn't find one.

Still in WIP. The minecraft path fonctionnality isn't working yet and there are some problems I have to resolve but it should work overall.

#################################### How it's working ####################################

1. Install Python if it is not already done (on W11, if you run the script, it will sugest you to install it from windows store)
2. Regroup your stats files into stats_folder, theses files are located in the stats folder of any maps. (You can also import your minecraft/curse folder but it's actually WIP)
3. Launch main.py and follow the instructions.
4. Enjoy
