# Minecraft-stats-combiner
Simple program to combine every one of your stats files into a merged one.
I decided to create it because I realized I couldn't find one.

Still in WIP. Can maybe be a bit buggy but the main fonctionality is working fine (locally at least)

#################################### How it's working ####################################

1. Install Python if it is not already done (If you try to run the script, it will sugest you to install it from windows store, at least on W11)
2. Launch main.py and follow the instructions.
3. You now have 2 choices :
3.1 (EASY) You can copy and paste your minecraft or curseforge path folder and the script will automatically import and export data from all your stats files.
3.2 (ADVANCED) You have to regroup your stats files into "stats_folder", theses files are located in the stats folder of any maps. You should only use this choice if you have multiples minecraft/curseforge folders.
3.3 So, to do it, you have to use the second (2) program and enter every curseforge or minecraft path folder you have, the program will now create severals .JSON in your script folder.
3.4 Move the .JSONs files into the stats_folder..folder and you can use the first (1) program to combine every combined stats files.
4. Enjoy !
